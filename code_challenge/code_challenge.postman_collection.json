It is a philosophy of personal eudaemonic virtue ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world, asserting that the practice of virtue is both necessary and sufficient to achieve eudaimonia—flourishing by means of living an ethical life. The Stoics identified the path to eudaimonia with a life spent practicing the cardinal virtues and living in accordance with nature. The Stoics are especially known for teaching that virtue is the only good for human beings, and those external things—such as health, wealth, and pleasure—are not good nor bad in themselves (adiaphora) but have value as material for virtue to act upon. Alongside Aristotelian ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics.[1] The Stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is in accordance with nature. Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how a person behaved.[2] To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature. Many Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that because virtue is sufficient for happiness, a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. This belief is similar to the meaning of the phrase stoic calm, though the phrase does not include the traditional Stoic view that only a sage can be considered truly free and that all moral corruptions are equally vicious.[3] Stoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century AD, and among its adherents was Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century AD. Since then, it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).[4]\",\r\n    \"author\": \"aristotle2000\"\r\n}",

Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\",\n        \"author\": \"jondoe01\",\n        \"comments\": [\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"6263db551cc6b2f5d0c2487d\",\n                \"article\": \"6263d5e9255b691b67bb97a0\",\n                \"content\": \"comment 1 untuk article lorem ipsum\",\n                \"from\": \"ali3001\",\n                \"created_date\": \"2022-04-23T10:56:21.176Z\",\n                \"updated_date\": \"2022-04-23T10:56:21.176Z\",\n                \"__v\": 0\n            },\n            {\n                \"_id\": \"6263db681cc6b2f5d0c24881\",\n                \"article\": \"6263d5e9255b691b67bb97a0\",\n                \"content\": \"comment 2 untuk article lorem ipsum\",\n                \"from\": \"jen1111\",\n                \"created_date\": \"2022-04-23T10:56:40.249Z\",\n                \"updated_date\": \"2022-04-23T10:56:40.249Z\",\n                \"__v\": 0\n            }\n        ],\n        \"created_date\": \"2022-04-23T10:33:13.494Z\",\n        \"updated_date\": \"2022-04-23T10:33:13.494Z\",\n        \"__v\": 0\n    }\n}"
